# React (ViteJS) Chess game starting. 

Will eventually end up with a websocket NodeJS server to allow people to play. 

Chess states will be stored in a database, so people can stop playing and come back later.

Chess AI will be developped eventually too, with multiple levels of difficulty, and different depths of best move choices.
